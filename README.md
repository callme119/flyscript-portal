Riverbed FlyScript Dashboard
============================

This Django project provides a web-based reporting capability utilizing the
FlyScript python package.

Installation Overview
---------------------

Along with a working python installation, the following packages will need to
be installed:

- rvbd-common>=0.1   (included with the Portal project)
- Django>=1.4.5
- django-model-utils==1.2.0
- djangorestframework==2.3.8
- django-extensions==1.1.1
- flyscript>=0.5.6
- jsonfield==0.9.5
- numpy>=1.7.0

- pygeoip>=0.2.6
- python-dateutil>=2.1
- pytz>=2013b
- six>=1.3.0
- wsgiref>=0.1.2

### Linux/Mac OS Install

After cloning this repository to a local directory, these dependencies can be
installed/checked by using the included requirements.txt file.  For example:

    $ cd /tmp
    $ git clone https://github.com/riverbed/flyscript-portal.git
    $ cd flyscript-portal
    $ cd rvbd-common
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cd ..
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

After reading up on the [configuration](#configuration), see the sections below for
[initializing the database](#initialize-the-database) and
[starting up the development server](#starting-the-server).

### Windows Install

The steps for Windows are a bit different due to the need for pre-compiled packages.  Assuming
you have Python 2.7 installed successfully, follow the steps below:

1. Install git if you haven't already
    1. Download installer from [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win)

    2. Open installer
        - Click next until you get to "Select Components"
        - Check "Windows Explorer integration" and "Simple context menu"
        - Check the two Git Here options
        - Leave other options as default and click through until Finish

2. Clone the flyscript-portal repository from github using "Git Bash" (Start --> All Programs --> Git --> Git Bash)

    1. Create a directory to store the project (you will start in "~" which
       is the same as C:\Users\your_username).  For example:

            $ cd ~
            $ mkdir flyscript
            $ cd flyscript

    2. Clone the project:

            $ git clone https://github.com/riverbed/flyscript-portal.git

    3. This will create a directory called `flyscript-portal`

    4. Go into this directory and check things out and install the core apps

            $ cd flyscript-portal
            $ cd rvbd-common
            $ python setup.py install
            $ cd ..
            $ ls
    5. Leave this window open for the next step.

3. Get pre-compiled python packages

    1. In the Git Bash window from step 2, determine which python you have
        by running the "python" command.

    2. Above the ">>>" you should see text including "[MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]"

    3. Download and install the correct numpy package from
       (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy).  Pick the
        correct 32 or 64 bit version based on what you see from starting
        python above.

    4. Download and install the correct pandas from
       (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pandas).  Pick the
        correct 32 or 64 bit version as above.

4. In the Git Bash window, install the remaining requirements

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

5. After reading up on the [configuration](#configuration), see the sections below for
[initializing the database](#initialize-the-database) and
[starting up the development server](#starting-the-server).


Configuration
-------------

All device and report configuration configuration is done by a set of configuration
files in the config directory:

- config/devices.py
    - the set of devices that will be queried for data
- config/locations.py
    - location defintions by CIDR for custom geo-ip mapping
- config/reports/*.py
    - reports, data tables and widgets

The config directory defines a set of 4 reports based on two devices
named "profiler" and "shark1" defined in config/devices.py.

To get started, edit the file `config/devices.py` and fill appropriate
values for the PROFILER device and the SHARK device.  At a minimum,
set the `host`, `username`, and `password` fields for each device.  For
the SHARK, a live view named 'flyscript-portal' is created on the
first available capture interface.

(If you only have a SHARK device, you can ignore the PROFILER
settings, it just means you won't be able to render any of the sample
PROFILER widgets.  Similarly if you just have a PROFILER, ignore the SHARK
settings.)

Customize the `config/locations.py` file to setup the IP address for
addresses spaces in your network (those addresses that are in the private
non-routable IP space such as 10/8 or 192.168/16).  This should typically
match your ByLocation host group configuration on Cascade Profiler.

Initializing the database
-------------------------

The `clean` script at the root of the project will perform the following:
- initialize the database, if it doesn't exist
- clean out any temporary files (log files, cache files, etc.)
- reload configurations from the config directory
- setup a default admin user with the login/password combo of 'admin'/'admin'
  (if the user already exists, the password will be reset to 'admin')

Run this script to reset everything.  This is useful if you experience oddities
when trying to access pages.  Given that all configuration is stored in config
files, this operation is safe to run at just about any time.

Note that the `clean` script is a bash shell script and will work on unix-like
systems.  If you are running this on Windows, you'll need to manually execute
each command or run this from the Git-Bash or Cygwin shell.

On unix-like systems:

    $ ./clean

To force the database to its original state, and really reset everything to ground-zero,
pass the '--reset' command to the script as follows:

    $ ./clean --reset


Starting the server
-------------------

The Django web server is started up using the manage.py script:

    $ python manage.py runserver

This starts up a development server running on port 8000 by default.
Now, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and you should
see a page with a criteria box open.  Just click "Run" and you should see some
plots.

*Note:*
This project utilizes file storage caching of the data results, and these files are
stored in the `datacache` directory.  Eventually these files will be automatically
cleaned, but in the interim, there are no ill effects if they are manually deleted
periodically to reclaim storage space.

Changing the admin password
---------------------------

After logging into the server for the first time, there will be an option under the
upper-right `Configure` button called `Preferences`.  From there, follow the link
titled `Change User Password` and a typical password change page will be shown.

Enabling Google Maps
--------------------

Google Maps/Google Earth API

Use of the Google Maps/Google Earth API may require login credentials from
Google such as an API Key or Client ID.  Please see Google’s website at
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial and
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/clientside/#MapsJS
for more information.  Please also see the LICENSE file available at
https://github.com/riverbed/flyscript-portal/blob/master/LICENSE for
information regarding licensing.


Enabling OpenStreetMap
----------------------

Please see the LICENSE file available at
https://github.com/riverbed/flyscript-portal/blob/master/LICENSE for
information regarding licensing of OpenStreetMap and MapQuest-OSM tiles.



Mapping locations for public IP address
---------------------------------------

The maps widget can identify public IP address using the GeoLite
database.  To enable this integration, download the GeoLite City database from
[MaxMind GeoLite Free Downloadable Databases](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite#Downloads-5).

Install the unpacked database at the file location: /tmp/GeoLiteCity.dat

Running Reports
===============

Currently, each report has the same criteria:

- End Time - the end time/date of the reporting interval that will be used

- Duration - the duration the reporting interval.  If left at 'Default', each
  widget in the report will use the duration configured for that widget's associated
  data table, which may be different for each table.

- Filter Expression - an arbitrary filter expression to be passed to the
  data source that will execute the query for a table.  The syntax of the
  expression is dependent on the datasource.

Note that since there may be a mix of different data sources in the
same report, the filter expression generally will not work in such
mixed reports because the filter expression syntax differs for each data
source.  This will will be addressed in a future release.

Defining Tables
===============

A data table is the root of data for a widget.  It defines the data source (one
of the modules in the apps/datasource/modules directory) and general table
attributes such as the default duration.

Columns are associated with the table and define the keys and values of interest.
Each data table may have any number of columns.

A column has the following common attributes:

- `name` - a simple name for referring to this column in the widget
- `label` - string label to used for display
- `iskey` - boolean indicating if this is a key column
- `datatype` - null, or one of 'metric', 'bytes', or 'time'
  - use 'metric' to automatically format the value with with metric unites
  - use 'bytes' to format as metric, but with Bytes attached
  - use 'time' for time based columns
- `units` - optional units for display purposes
- `module` - defines the module to use to query for data

In addition, each column supports an `options` attribute with defines additional
configuration options relevant to the the data source that will be performing
the query for this column.

A new data source may be defined by adding a new module to the apps/datasource/modules
directory.  See the existing modules as an example.

Defining Widgets
================

Widgets are the UI representations of a data table.  Multiple widgets may be
associated with the same table, for example to show both a bar chart and a
pie chart of the same data.

Each widget simply binds a table to a particular widget type.  The possible
widget types are defined by the modules in apps/report/modules.

Widgets have the following attributes:

- `title` - the display title
- `width` - the column width for the widget, each page is 12 columns wide, defaults
  to 6 for half width
- `height` - the height in pixels, defaults to 300
- `module` - defines the module to use to render this widget
- `uiwidget` - defines the specific widget within the module

Widget specific options are specified in the `options` attribute.

A new widget may be defined by adding appropriate code to an existing
module or create new module in the apps/datasource/modules
directory.  See the existing modules and widgets as an example.
Note that each module and uiwidget has associated JavaScript code
in the apps/report/static/js directory that handles turning the
data and options into rendered widget.
